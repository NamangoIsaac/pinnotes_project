This is the final portfolio project which wraps up our backend specialization in alx. This project aims to create an interactive yet effective note taking app where users can create notes to organize their thoughts. It also allows the user to store related notes in a folder and manipulate them. The app consist of a main dashboard which displays the recently accessed notes and folders. It also has a sidebar navigation which allows the user to move from one folder to another. The app most importantly has an editor window where users write, format, and edit their notes. The window should allow the user to editing, formatting and should support a wide range of  fonts.
